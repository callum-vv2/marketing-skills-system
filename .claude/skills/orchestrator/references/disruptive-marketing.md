# Disruptive Marketing Framework

The edge that separates forgettable brands from unforgettable ones. This framework enables challenger brand positioning, provocative messaging, and calculated risk-taking.

## Philosophy

> "If you want to be interesting, you have to be interested in taking risks." — Dave Trott

Most marketing is wallpaper. It follows conventions, uses safe language, and disappears into the noise. Disruptive marketing breaks patterns, challenges assumptions, and creates talk value.

**The Core Truth:** Playing it safe is the riskiest strategy. In a world of infinite content, being forgettable is death.

## Challenger Brand Legends

### Adam Morgan - Eating the Big Fish

**Framework:** The 8 Credos of Challenger Brands

| Credo | Meaning | Application |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **Intelligent Naivety** | Question industry assumptions | Ask "why do we do it this way?" |
| **Lighthouse Identity** | Stand for something, not everything | Bold positioning over broad appeal |
| **Assume Thought Leadership** | Act like the leader before you are | Confidence in messaging |
| **Create Symbols of Re-evaluation** | Force people to see the category differently | Disruptive visuals, language |
| **Sacrifice** | Say no to be distinctive | Kill features, audiences, conventions |
| **Overcommit** | Go all-in on fewer things | Depth over breadth |
| **Use Advertising as a High-Leverage Asset** | Punch above your weight | Creative > media spend |
| **Become Ideas-Centered** | Culture of challenger thinking | Every touchpoint disrupts |

**When to Apply:** When competing against established players with bigger budgets.

### Dave Trott - Predatory Thinking

**Core Principle:** Do the opposite of what's expected. The crowd is usually wrong.

**Trott's Rules:**
1. **Impact before communication** - If they don't notice it, the message doesn't matter
2. **Simple before complicated** - Complexity is the enemy of execution
3. **New before improved** - Novelty beats iteration
4. **Different before better** - Stand out, then stand for something

**Predatory Questions:**
- What does everyone in our category do? (Do the opposite)
- What's the unspoken rule? (Break it)
- What are competitors afraid to say? (Say it)
- What's the uncomfortable truth? (Lead with it)

### Rory Sutherland - Alchemy & Behavioral Contrarianism

**Core Insight:** Logic is overrated. Psychological value often beats functional value.

**Sutherland's Counterintuitive Principles:**

| Conventional Wisdom | Contrarian Truth |
|---------------------|------------------|
| Make things easy | Sometimes friction adds value |
| Lower prices to win | Higher prices can signal quality |
| More features = better | Constraints create desire |
| Explain benefits rationally | Irrational appeals often work better |
| Remove all barriers | Barriers can create exclusivity |

**Application:** Look for opportunities where the "obvious" solution is wrong. Create value through perception, not just function.

### Ryan Holiday - Provocative Positioning

**From "Trust Me, I'm Lying" and "Perennial Seller":**

**Controversy as Strategy:**
- Polarization beats neutrality
- Haters create fans (and vice versa)
- Being talked about > being liked
- Manufactured controversy vs. authentic provocation

**When Controversy Works:**
- You have a genuine point of view
- You're willing to lose some customers
- The controversy aligns with brand values
- You can back up provocative claims

**When It Backfires:**
- Controversy for controversy's sake
- Punching down, not up
- Inconsistent with brand behavior
- Can't handle the heat

## Risk Assessment Framework

### Brand Boldness Score

Before creating content, assess brand's risk tolerance:

| Factor | Low (1-2) | Medium (3-4) | High (5) |
|--------|-----------|--------------|----------|
| **Industry** | Regulated (finance, health) | Professional services | Consumer, lifestyle |
| **Audience** | Conservative, older | Mixed | Young, progressive |
| **Brand Age** | Established, legacy | Growing | Startup, challenger |
| **Competition** | All playing safe | Mixed approaches | Already edgy players |
| **Leadership** | Risk-averse | Open to ideas | Actively wants edge |
| **Stakes** | High consequence errors | Moderate | Low, can pivot fast |

**Scoring:**
- 6-12: Play it safer, edge through wit not shock
- 13-20: Can push boundaries selectively
- 21-30: Go full challenger, take calculated risks

### Risk vs. Reward Matrix

| Risk Level | Approach | Example |
|------------|----------|---------|
| **Safe Edge** | Wit, cleverness, unexpected angles | Innocent Drinks' playful packaging |
| **Moderate Push** | Challenge conventions, call out competitors | Oatly attacking dairy industry |
| **Bold Provocation** | Break taboos, polarize intentionally | Liquid Death's death metal water |
| **Maximum Disruption** | Stunt marketing, manufactured controversy | Cards Against Humanity's Black Friday |

## Disruptive Tactics Playbook

### 1. Sacred Cow Slaughter

Attack the unquestioned beliefs in your industry.

**Process:**
1. List industry "truths" everyone accepts
2. Question each one: "Is this actually true?"
3. Find the ones that are bullshit
4. Build messaging that exposes them

**Examples:**
- Oatly: "Milk is healthy" → "It's literally for baby cows"
- BrewDog: "Craft beer is pretentious" → "Punk IPA for everyone"
- Liquid Death: "Water brands are boring" → "Murder your thirst"

### 2. The Uncomfortable Truth

Say what everyone thinks but no one says.

**Formula:**
> "Everyone knows [uncomfortable truth], but no one talks about it. We're different because [how you address it]."

**Examples:**
- "Most software demos are a waste of time. We'll tell you if we're not a fit."
- "Your current provider doesn't care about you. Here's their retention playbook."
- "This industry is full of bullshit. Let's cut through it."

### 3. Self-Deprecation as Weapon

Disarm through honesty about your weaknesses.

**Why It Works:**
- Builds trust through unexpected honesty
- Makes other claims more believable
- Humanizes the brand
- Creates memorability

**Examples:**
- RyanAir: "We know we're cheap. That's the point."
- Surreal: "We couldn't afford real celebrities"
- Avis: "We're #2, so we try harder"

### 4. Enemy Creation

Define yourself by what you're against.

**The Enemy Framework:**
- **Industry Enemy:** The way things have always been done
- **Competitor Enemy:** A specific player (carefully chosen)
- **Conceptual Enemy:** An idea or behavior to fight against

**Rules for Picking Enemies:**
- Punch up, not down
- Enemy should be genuinely problematic
- Your alternative must be legitimately better
- Be specific, not vague

### 5. Pattern Interrupt

Break the expected format completely.

**Tactics:**
- Use unexpected visuals (Liquid Death's metal aesthetic)
- Wrong tone for category (funeral home humor)
- Unexpected medium (hand-written CEO letters)
- Break fourth wall (acknowledge it's an ad)
- Absurdist humor (Nutter Butter's unhinged content)

### 6. Manufactured Scarcity & Exclusivity

Make people fight to get in.

**Tactics:**
- Waitlists with uncertain timelines
- Application processes to buy
- Limited drops, no restocks
- Rejection of "wrong fit" customers
- Anti-availability (Superhuman's deliberate constraints)

## When NOT to Be Disruptive

Disruption isn't always the answer:

**Pull Back When:**
- Dealing with genuine customer pain/complaints
- Sensitive topics (death, illness, tragedy)
- B2B enterprise sales (usually)
- Regulated industries with real consequences
- You haven't earned the right yet (new brand, no track record)
- The product can't back up bold claims

**The Line:**
- Punch up, never down
- Clever > cruel
- Confident > arrogant
- Provocative > offensive
- Polarizing > alienating everyone

---
