## Peep Laja - CRO & Conversion

**Key Works:**
- Founder of CXL (ConversionXL)
- Speero agency
- Wynter (B2B message testing)

**Core Frameworks:**

### The Clarity Trumps Persuasion Principle
> "Confused people don't convert."

Before trying to persuade, make sure:
- They know what you do
- They know who it's for
- They know what to do next

### The Specificity Principle
Specific > Vague

- "Join 50,000+ marketers" > "Join thousands"
- "Get results in 14 days" > "Get results fast"
- "$2.3M saved for clients" > "Significant savings"

### Homepage Hierarchy
1. Hero: What + Who + Value
2. Proof: Why believe you
3. How: How it works
4. What: Features/details
5. CTA: What to do

## Donald Miller - StoryBrand

**Key Works:**
- "Building a StoryBrand" (book)
- StoryBrand Framework

**Core Framework:**

### The StoryBrand 7-Part Framework

1. **Character** - The customer is the hero (not you)
2. **Problem** - External, internal, philosophical
3. **Guide** - You are the guide (with empathy + authority)
4. **Plan** - Simple steps to success
5. **Call to Action** - Direct and clear
6. **Failure** - What they avoid
7. **Success** - The transformation

### The Grunt Test
Within 5 seconds of landing on your site, can someone answer:
1. What do you offer?
2. How will it make my life better?
3. What do I need to do to get it?

If you pass the "grunt test" (caveman could understand it), you're clear.

## Oli Gardner - Landing Page Optimization

**Key Works:**
- Co-founder of Unbounce
- Landing page optimization expert

**Core Frameworks:**

### Attention Ratio
The ratio of links on a page to conversion goals.

**Ideal:** 1:1 (one link for one goal)

**Bad:** 50:1 (navigation, footer links, etc. competing)

### Message Match
The headline on your landing page must match:
- The ad that brought them there
- The email that sent them
- The expectation they arrived with

**Disconnect = bounce**

### The 5-Second Test
Show your page to someone for 5 seconds. Then ask:
- What does this company do?
- What are they offering?
- What should you do next?

If they can't answer all three, your copy isn't clear enough.
