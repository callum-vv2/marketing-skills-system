# Human Content Guidelines

This system produces content that sounds like a sharp, opinionated human wrote it—not a language model trained on the internet's mediocrity.

---

## The Problem

AI-generated content has tells. Readers, even unconsciously, pattern-match against these tells and dismiss content that feels "off." Google's algorithms increasingly detect and deprioritize AI-sounding content. More importantly: AI-generic content doesn't convert because it doesn't connect.

**The goal:** Every piece of content should pass the "Did a person write this?" test.

## AI Content Red Flags

### Structural Tells

| Pattern | Why It's a Tell | Instead |
|---------|-----------------|---------|
| **Always 3 bullet points** | AI defaults to triads | Vary: 2, 4, 5, 7 points. Or no bullets at all. |
| **Perfect parallel structure** | Every list item same format | Mix it up. Some long, some short. Some fragments. |
| **Header → 3 bullets → transition → repeat** | Predictable rhythm | Vary section lengths. Some long, some one-liners. |
| **"Introduction" and "Conclusion" headers** | Academic structure AI learned | Just start. Just end. No announcements. |
| **Every section same length** | Mechanical consistency | Some sections get 3 paragraphs, some get 1 sentence. |
| **Numbered lists for everything** | AI loves enumeration | Use prose. Let ideas flow. |

### Phrase-Level Tells

**Kill These Phrases:**

| AI Crutch | What to Do Instead |
|-----------|-------------------|
| "In today's fast-paced world..." | Just make your point. Cut the windup. |
| "Let's dive in" / "Let's explore" | Start diving. Don't announce it. |
| "It's important to note that..." | If it's important, just say it. |
| "In conclusion..." | Stop. Just conclude. |
| "This comprehensive guide will..." | Don't describe the content. BE the content. |
| "Furthermore" / "Moreover" / "Additionally" | Use "And." Or just start a new sentence. |
| "In order to" | "To" |
| "It goes without saying" | Then don't say it. |
| "At the end of the day" | Delete. |
| "When it comes to [X]" | Just talk about X. |
| "Utilize" | "Use" |
| "Leverage" (as verb) | "Use" or be specific |
| "Facilitate" | Say what actually happens |
| "Robust" / "Comprehensive" / "Cutting-edge" | Be specific or cut |
| "Unlock" / "Unleash" / "Harness" | Banned unless literal |
| "Navigate" (non-literal) | Just say what you mean |
| "Landscape" (non-literal) | "Market," "situation," or be specific |
| "Ecosystem" (non-tech) | Usually meaningless. Cut or be specific. |
| "Synergy" / "Synergize" | No. |
| "Best-in-class" | Prove it or cut it. |
| "World-class" | Same. |
| "Seamless" / "Seamlessly" | Describe what actually happens. |

**The Transition Problem:**

AI loves mechanical transitions:
- "That being said..."
- "With that in mind..."
- "Moving on to..."
- "Now that we've covered X, let's look at Y..."

Human writing just... moves. The connection is implied or natural. You don't need a bridge for every thought.

### Tone Tells

| AI Pattern | Human Pattern |
|------------|---------------|
| Relentlessly balanced | Has opinions, takes sides |
| Hedges everything ("may," "might," "could") | Makes claims, accepts risk of being wrong |
| Neutral on controversy | Has a take |
| Defines every term | Assumes reader intelligence |
| Over-explains | Trusts the reader to keep up |
| Avoids personality | Has voice quirks |
| Never uses contractions | Uses "don't," "can't," "won't" naturally |
| Perfect grammar always | Starts sentences with "And." Or "But." Fragments. |
| No humor | Has moments of wit, sarcasm, levity |
| Generic examples | Specific, real-world examples |

### Content Tells

| AI Pattern | Human Pattern |
|------------|---------------|
| Covers everything equally | Spends time on what matters, skips the obvious |
| No original insights | Has a point of view based on experience |
| Generic advice | Specific, actionable, sometimes controversial takes |
| No personal anecdotes | Shares relevant stories, failures, learnings |
| Cites "studies show" vaguely | Cites specific sources or admits opinion |
| Never wrong or uncertain | Acknowledges limits, changes mind sometimes |
| Covers all sides equally | Advocates for a position |

## Human Content Patterns

### Voice Markers

**Contractions:** Use them. "Don't" not "do not." "It's" not "it is." "Won't" not "will not."

**Sentence Fragments:** For emphasis. Like this. Works.

**Starting with conjunctions:** And that's fine. But don't overdo it.

**Parenthetical asides:** (These add personality and break up rhythm.)

**Direct address:** Talk TO the reader. "You" is powerful. "Your" makes it personal.

**Questions:** Real ones, not rhetorical fluff. What do you actually want to know?

**Strong opinions:** "X is wrong." Not "X may not be the optimal approach in certain circumstances."

**Personality quirks:** The specific way YOU would say something, not the generic way.

### Structure Variety

Instead of: H2 → 3 bullets → paragraph → H2 → 3 bullets...

Try:
- H2 → one killer sentence → H3 with deep detail
- Long paragraph → punchy one-liner → table
- Story → insight → no bullets at all
- Five bullets, then seven, then two
- Section that's just a question and answer
- Block quote that does the heavy lifting

### The "Actually Helpful" Test

AI content often SEEMS helpful while being useless:
- "Consider your goals before making a decision" (no shit)
- "It depends on your specific situation" (thanks for nothing)
- "There are pros and cons to both approaches" (coward)

Human content:
- "Here's what I'd do in your shoes: X. Because Y."
- "Most advice says Z. That's wrong. Here's why."
- "If you have [situation A], do X. If [situation B], do Y. Everything else, do Z."

Take a stand. Be useful. Risk being wrong.

## The Human Content Checklist

Before publishing anything, verify:

### Structural Check
- [ ] Bullet point lists vary in length (not always 3)
- [ ] Section lengths vary significantly
- [ ] No "Introduction" / "Conclusion" headers
- [ ] Some ideas expressed in prose, not lists
- [ ] Structure feels organic, not mechanical

### Language Check
- [ ] Contractions used naturally
- [ ] No AI crutch phrases (reference list above)
- [ ] Transitions are natural or absent
- [ ] Some sentences are fragments. For effect.
- [ ] Starts some sentences with "And" or "But"
- [ ] Uses "you" and "your" directly

### Voice Check
- [ ] Has clear opinions, not just balanced takes
- [ ] Includes at least one strong claim or hot take
- [ ] No excessive hedging (may, might, could, perhaps)
- [ ] Has personality—could identify the writer by voice
- [ ] Includes specific examples, not generic ones
- [ ] Has moments of wit, humor, or humanity

### Content Check
- [ ] Says something original, not just aggregated consensus
- [ ] Spends more time on non-obvious points
- [ ] Takes sides on debatable issues
- [ ] Acknowledges limits or uncertainties honestly
- [ ] Would actually help someone, not just seem helpful

### The Ultimate Test
- [ ] **Read it aloud.** Does it sound like a person talking?
- [ ] **Cover the source.** Would you know AI wrote this?
- [ ] **The bar test.** Could you explain this the same way to a friend at a bar?

## Rewriting AI-Sounding Content

### Before (AI-generic):
```
In today's fast-paced digital landscape, it's more important than ever to leverage social media marketing effectively. There are several key strategies to consider:

1. Develop a comprehensive content strategy
2. Engage with your audience consistently
3. Analyze your metrics to optimize performance

By implementing these best practices, you can unlock the full potential of your social media presence and drive meaningful results for your business.
```

### After (Human):
```
Most social media advice is useless. "Post consistently" and "engage with your audience" aren't strategies—they're descriptions of what social media is.

Here's what actually moves the needle:

Post stuff worth sharing. Not "valuable content"—stuff people screenshot and send to friends. If your posts wouldn't survive outside your follower bubble, they're not working.

Stop chasing algorithms. Chasing every platform change is exhausting and pointless. Pick a format that works for you and get really good at it.

Measure one thing. Followers don't pay rent. Neither do likes. Pick the one metric that actually matters to your business and ignore the rest.

"But what about—"

No. Simplify. Do less. Do it better.
```

### The Transformation:
- Killed the windup ("In today's fast-paced...")
- Removed AI transitions
- Broke the 3-bullet pattern
- Added strong opinions
- Used contractions and direct address
- Included voice and personality
- Made it actually useful

## Implementation

Every skill in this system should:

1. **Reference this guide** in the skill file
2. **Include a human-check** in the output process
3. **Vary outputs** to avoid predictable patterns
4. **Inject personality** appropriate to brand voice
5. **Flag AI tells** for revision before finalizing

The goal isn't perfect prose. It's authentic communication that sounds like it came from a human with opinions, experiences, and a point of view—because that's what connects.
