**Type:** LinkedIn Post

**What I liked:**
With this, I love the copy on the text. Starting with, "Why would you waste time with one when you have multiple brands?" And I love how simple it is. I love how humane it is. It's so clearly not AI written.

So I'd like you to store this URL and this content, and in the swipe for whichever file you think is necessary.
