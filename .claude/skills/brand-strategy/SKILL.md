- **Seth Godin** - Tribe building, permission marketing
- **Denise Lee Yohn** - Brand leadership and culture
- **Adam Morgan** - Eating the Big Fish, challenger brand strategy
- **Byron Sharp** - How Brands Grow, mental availability, distinctiveness
- **Daniel Kahneman** - System 1/System 2 thinking in brand perception

## Required References

Before creating brand strategy, review:
- `orchestrator/references/neuroscience-marketing.md` - Brain science validation
- `orchestrator/references/human-content-guidelines.md` - Authentic output standards
- `orchestrator/references/disruptive-marketing.md` - Challenger brand options

## Your Role

Define brand strategy that:
1. Establishes brand purpose, mission, and vision
2. Defines brand personality and archetype
3. Creates emotional connection with customers
4. Guides all brand expressions and touchpoints
5. Differentiates through identity, not just features

## Dependencies

**Required before running:**
- `market-positioning` - Strategic position and differentiation
- `value-proposition` - Core value and messaging
- `customer-research` - ICP, personas, emotional needs

**Load context from:**
- `source-of-truth/market-positioning.json` - Positioning, category strategy
- `source-of-truth/value-proposition.json` - Value prop, messaging hierarchy
- `source-of-truth/customer-research.json` - Personas, emotional needs

## Frameworks to Apply

### David Ogilvy's Brand Image

**Brand as Personality:**
- Every ad is an investment in brand image
- Brand personality should be consistent and distinctive
- Aim for first-class image from day one

**Brand Elements:**
- Visual identity
- Tone of voice
- Emotional associations
- Quality signals

### Marty Neumeier's Brand Gap

**5 Disciplines of Brand Building:**
1. **Differentiate** - Be radically different
2. **Collaborate** - Build with others
3. **Innovate** - Keep evolving
4. **Validate** - Test with audience
5. **Cultivate** - Live the brand

**Brand Test:** Can you describe your brand in 12 words or less in a way that no competitor could use?

### Seth Godin's Tribal Branding

**Tribe Principles:**
- Brands lead tribes, not markets
- Connect people who want to be connected
- Give people something to believe in
- Create us vs. them narrative

**Permission Marketing:**
- Earn attention, don't demand it
- Deliver anticipated, personal, relevant messages
- Build assets, not campaigns

### Brand Archetypes

**12 Archetypes:**
1. **Innocent** - Safety, optimism (Coca-Cola)
2. **Explorer** - Freedom, discovery (Patagonia)
3. **Sage** - Knowledge, wisdom (Google)
4. **Hero** - Mastery, courage (Nike)
5. **Outlaw** - Liberation, disruption (Harley-Davidson)
6. **Magician** - Transformation (Apple)
7. **Regular Guy** - Belonging (IKEA)
8. **Lover** - Intimacy, pleasure (Victoria's Secret)
9. **Jester** - Joy, fun (Old Spice)
10. **Caregiver** - Service, nurture (Johnson & Johnson)
11. **Creator** - Innovation, vision (LEGO)
12. **Ruler** - Control, leadership (Mercedes)

### Adam Morgan's Challenger Brand Strategy

**Reference:** See `orchestrator/references/disruptive-marketing.md` for full framework.

**The 8 Credos of Challenger Brands:**

| Credo | Meaning | Application |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **Intelligent Naivety** | Question everything | "Why do we do it this way?" |
| **Lighthouse Identity** | Stand for something specific | Bold positioning over broad appeal |
| **Assume Thought Leadership** | Act like the leader | Confidence before credentials |
| **Symbols of Re-evaluation** | Force category rethinking | Disruptive visuals, language, behavior |
| **Sacrifice** | Say no to be distinctive | Kill features, audiences, conventions |
| **Overcommit** | Go all-in on fewer things | Depth over breadth |
| **Advertising as Leverage** | Creative > media spend | Punch above weight class |
| **Ideas-Centered** | Culture of challenge | Every touchpoint disrupts |

**When to Use Challenger Positioning:**
- Competing against bigger, established players
- Limited marketing budget vs. competitors
- Category has stale, similar-looking brands
- Audience is tired of industry conventions
- Product genuinely does something different

### Brand Boldness Assessment

**Score your brand's risk tolerance (1-5 each):**

| Factor | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **Industry Norms** | 1=Regulated, 5=Consumer/lifestyle | How much room for edge? |
| **Audience Appetite** | 1=Conservative, 5=Progressive | Will they reward boldness? |
| **Brand Maturity** | 1=Established legacy, 5=New challenger | How much permission to disrupt? |
| **Competition** | 1=All playing safe, 5=Already edgy players | Is bold a differentiator? |
| **Leadership Tolerance** | 1=Risk-averse, 5=Wants edge | Will bold work get approved? |
| **Consequence of Failure** | 1=High stakes, 5=Can pivot fast | What's the downside? |

**Total Score Interpretation:**
- **6-12:** Safe edge - wit and cleverness, not shock
- **13-20:** Moderate push - challenge conventions selectively
- **21-30:** Full challenger mode - take calculated risks, be provocative

### Brand Positioning Mode

Based on boldness score, choose positioning mode:

| Mode | Score | Approach | Reference Brands |
|------|-------|----------|------------------|
| **Classic** | 6-12 | Quality, trust, expertise | IBM, McKinsey, Deloitte |
| **Confident** | 13-17 | Opinionated, clear POV | Basecamp, Stripe, Linear |
| **Challenger** | 18-23 | Category disruptor, bold claims | Oatly, BrewDog, Drift |
| **Provocateur** | 24-30 | Deliberately polarizing, edgy | Liquid Death, Duolingo, RyanAir |

### Neuroscience of Brand Building

**Reference:** `orchestrator/references/neuroscience-marketing.md`

**How Brands Live in the Brain:**

| Concept | What It Means | Brand Strategy Implication |
|---------|---------------|---------------------------|
| **Mental Availability** | Being easily recalled in buying situations | Build distinctive assets, reach broadly, link to Category Entry Points |
| **System 1 Processing** | Fast, automatic, emotional brand judgments | Make brand identity instantly recognizable, emotionally resonant |
| **Memory Structures** | Neural networks that form brand associations | Consistently reinforce the same associations over time |
| **Distinctiveness** | Standing out from competitive clutter | Unique visual/verbal assets > trying to be "better" |
| **Emotional Encoding** | Emotions strengthen memory formation | Brand personality should trigger clear emotional response |

**Brand Asset Neuroscience:**

Strong brand assets work because they:
1. **Trigger instant recognition** - System 1 processes them without effort
2. **Create neural shortcuts** - The asset = the brand = the feeling
3. **Build through repetition** - Consistent use strengthens pathways
4. **Are distinctive** - Von Restorff effect: different things are remembered

**Category Entry Points (CEPs):**

CEPs are the mental triggers that make people think of your category. Link your brand to as many as possible:

| CEP Type | Example | How to Link |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| **Situations** | "Need to send a document" | Be present in that context |
| **Needs** | "Want to feel productive" | Associate brand with that feeling |
| **Motivations** | "Impress the client" | Show how brand delivers |
| **Times** | "Monday morning" | Be the brand for that moment |

**Validation Questions:**
- Will this brand be easily recalled when the need arises?
- Is it distinctive enough to cut through?
- Does it create a clear emotional response?
- Are we building consistent memory structures?

## Interaction Flow

### Mode 1: Brainstorming Partner

Start by synthesizing upstream research:

```
"Let's define your brand strategy.

From positioning, I see:
- [Position and category]
- [Key differentiators]

From value proposition, I see:
- [Core value]
- [Messaging themes]

From customer research, I see:
- [Who they are emotionally]
- [What they value]

Let's explore your brand identity:

1. If your brand were a person, how would you describe them?
2. What do you want customers to FEEL when they interact with you?
3. What's the enemy of your brand? (What are you against?)
4. What tribe do you lead? What do they believe?"
```

Ask clarifying questions:
- "What brands (any industry) do you admire? Why?"
- "What would your brand never do or say?"
- "What personality traits should come through?"
- "If someone recommended you, what would they say?"
- "What makes someone a true fan vs. just a customer?"

### Mode 2: Analysis & Output

Develop brand strategy through:

1. **Brand Purpose** - Why you exist beyond profit
2. **Brand Personality** - Human traits and characteristics
3. **Brand Archetype** - Primary and secondary archetypes
4. **Brand Promise** - What you guarantee
5. **Brand Story** - Origin narrative
6. **Visual Direction** - Color, typography, imagery guidance
