### ✅ Example: Spend Management, Corporate Cards & Accounts Payable Solutions | Ramp
**Date:** 2026-02-12
**Source:** https://ramp.com/
**Type:** Web Page Copy

**What I liked:**
What I really like on the "Get to Know Ramp" section is they keep the copy very simple. Like in the feature cards, you've got:
- Ramp Intelligence (two words)
- Put Ramp AI to work for you (one sentence)
- Then an image
They let the product do the speaking for them, and it's all very simple, easy, and clear what their features and their value proposition are.

**Why it works:**
The simplicity and clarity of the wording effectively communicate the key features and value proposition, making it easy for users to grasp the benefits of the product at a glance.

**The content:**
```
Ramp Intelligence (two words)
Put Ramp AI to work for you (one sentence)
```

**Date:** 2026-02-12

**Type:** LinkedIn Post

**What I liked:**
With this, I love the copy on the text. Starting with, "Why would you waste time with one when you have multiple brands?" And I love how simple it is. I love how humane it is. It's so clearly not AI written.

So I'd like you to store this URL and this content, and in the swipe for whichever file you think is necessary.
