# Neuroscience Marketing Framework

Every piece of marketing this system creates should be validated against how the human brain actually works—not how we wish it worked.

## Core Principle

> "The brain is not a logic machine. It's a survival machine that happens to be capable of logic sometimes." — Based on Kahneman

Marketing that ignores neuroscience is guessing. Marketing that leverages it is engineering.

## The Legends

### Daniel Kahneman - System 1 & System 2

**From "Thinking, Fast and Slow":**

| System 1 (Fast) | System 2 (Slow) |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Automatic, effortless | Deliberate, effortful |
| Emotional, intuitive | Rational, analytical |
| Always on | Lazy, avoids work |
| Makes 95% of decisions | Only engaged when necessary |
| Can't be turned off | Easily fatigued |

**Marketing Implications:**

1. **Target System 1 first.** If your message requires System 2 thinking to understand, most people will skip it.

2. **Cognitive ease wins.** Easy to process = feels true. Hard to process = feels suspicious.

3. **Emotions drive decisions.** System 2 rationalizes what System 1 already decided.

4. **Reduce cognitive load.** Every extra step, word, or choice depletes System 2 and increases abandonment.

**Cognitive Biases to Leverage:**

| Bias | What It Is | Marketing Application |
|------|------------|----------------------|
| **Anchoring** | First number sets the reference | Show high price first, then actual price |
| **Loss Aversion** | Losses hurt 2x more than gains | "Don't miss out" > "Get this" |
| **Availability Heuristic** | Easy to recall = seems common | Make your brand memorable, distinctive |
| **Confirmation Bias** | Seek info that confirms beliefs | Align with existing worldviews |
| **Halo Effect** | One positive trait colors all | Lead with strongest attribute |
| **WYSIATI** | What You See Is All There Is | Control the information environment |
| **Peak-End Rule** | Remember peaks and endings | Nail the first and last impression |

### Rory Sutherland - Behavioral Economics & Alchemy

**From "Alchemy" and Ogilvy Behavioral Science:**

**Core Insight:** Psychological value is real value. Often more powerful than functional value.

**Sutherland's Principles:**

1. **Logic is overrated.** The "rational" solution is often wrong because humans aren't rational.

2. **Context changes everything.** The same thing presented differently IS a different thing to the brain.

3. **Perception IS reality.** If people believe it's better, it IS better (for them).

4. **Costly signals work.** Inefficiency can signal quality (expensive = good).

5. **Friction can add value.** IKEA effect—we value what we work for.

**Counterintuitive Marketing Truths:**

| Conventional Wisdom | Sutherland's Take |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| Make it easy | Sometimes friction increases value |
| Lower price wins | Higher price can signal quality |
| More features = better | Constraints create desire |
| Explain benefits logically | Irrational appeals often work better |
| Remove all barriers | Barriers create exclusivity |

**The Red Bus Test:**
> "Would anyone notice if this ad were on a red bus driving past?" If your marketing is forgettable, it's worthless.

### Mark Ritson - Marketing Effectiveness

**Key Frameworks:**

**Brand vs. Performance Marketing:**
- Brand building: Long-term memory structures, emotional, broad reach
- Performance marketing: Short-term activation, rational, targeted
- **Optimal split: 60% brand / 40% performance** (varies by category)

**Distinctiveness > Differentiation:**
- Differentiation: Being better (hard, temporary)
- Distinctiveness: Being memorable (easier, lasting)
- Build brand assets: colors, sounds, characters, taglines

**Mental Availability:**
- Being thought of in buying situations
- Built through consistent, distinctive, broad-reach marketing
- Not the same as awareness—it's being RECALLED at the right moment

**Physical Availability:**
- Being easy to buy when they think of you
- Distribution, convenience, friction reduction

### Byron Sharp - How Brands Grow

**From the Ehrenberg-Bass Institute:**

**Laws of Marketing (Evidence-Based):**

1. **Double Jeopardy:** Small brands have fewer buyers AND those buyers buy less often. Growth comes from acquiring more buyers, not loyalty.

2. **Reach > Frequency:** Broad reach matters more than hammering the same people.

3. **Mental Availability:** Be easy to think of. Build memory structures through:
   - Distinctive brand assets
   - Consistent execution
   - Broad reach over time

4. **Category Entry Points (CEPs):** The situations when people think of your category. Link your brand to as many CEPs as possible.

5. **Light Buyers Matter:** Most of your revenue comes from occasional buyers, not super-fans.

### The Adaptive Brain - Modern Neuroscience

**How Memory Works for Marketing:**

1. **Encoding:** Information must get in
   - Requires attention (increasingly scarce)
   - Enhanced by emotion, novelty, relevance
   - Weakened by cognitive overload

2. **Storage:** Information must stick
   - Repetition builds neural pathways
   - Emotional memories are stronger
   - Distinctive > generic (von Restorff effect)

3. **Retrieval:** Information must come back
   - Triggered by cues (brand assets)
   - Context-dependent (CEPs)
   - Competes with other memories

**The Attention Economy:**

| Challenge | Implication |
|-----------|-------------|
| Attention is scarce | Hook in first 1-3 seconds or lose them |
| Multitasking is default | Assume partial attention always |
| Pattern recognition is automatic | Break patterns to get noticed |
| Familiarity breeds comfort | But also invisibility (banner blindness) |

**Emotional Processing:**

- Amygdala processes emotional stimuli before conscious awareness
- Emotional reactions happen in ~200ms; conscious thought takes ~500ms+
- Emotional memories are stored differently (more durable)
- **Implication:** Lead with emotion, follow with logic

**Dopamine & Anticipation:**

- Dopamine spikes highest during ANTICIPATION, not reward
- The promise of value > the delivery of value (for attention)
- Variable rewards are more engaging than predictable ones
- **Implication:** Create anticipation, tease, build curiosity

## The Neuroscience Validation Framework

Every piece of marketing should pass these checks:

### 1. Attention Check
- [ ] Does it grab attention in <3 seconds?
- [ ] Is there a pattern interrupt or novelty?
- [ ] Is it distinctive from competitors?
- [ ] Will it be noticed in a distracted, scrolling state?

### 2. Processing Check
- [ ] Is it easy to process (cognitive fluency)?
- [ ] Does it target System 1 thinking?
- [ ] Is the core message clear without effort?
- [ ] Are you asking for minimal cognitive load?

### 3. Emotion Check
- [ ] Does it trigger an emotional response?
- [ ] Which emotion: fear, desire, curiosity, belonging, pride?
- [ ] Is the emotion appropriate to the context?
- [ ] Does emotion come before logic in the sequence?

### 4. Memory Check
- [ ] Will this be remembered?
- [ ] Does it use distinctive brand assets?
- [ ] Is there a "peak" moment that will stick?
- [ ] Does it link to Category Entry Points?

### 5. Decision Check
- [ ] Does it reduce friction to act?
- [ ] Are cognitive biases being leveraged appropriately?
- [ ] Is the CTA clear and easy?
- [ ] Is there urgency or scarcity (if appropriate)?

### 6. Trust Check
- [ ] Does it align with existing beliefs (confirmation bias)?
- [ ] Is there social proof for System 1?
- [ ] Are there costly signals of quality?
- [ ] Does it feel authentic (not manipulative)?

## Neuroscience by Marketing Type

### For Headlines & Hooks
- **Novelty:** Brain prioritizes new/unexpected information
- **Relevance:** Self-referential processing is strongest
- **Curiosity Gap:** Open loops demand closure
- **Emotion Words:** Processed faster than neutral words
- **Specificity:** Concrete > abstract (easier to visualize)

### For Landing Pages
- **F-Pattern Reading:** Most important info top-left
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Don't overwhelm; reveal gradually
- **Social Proof Placement:** Near decision points
- **Visual Hierarchy:** Guide attention intentionally
- **Friction Reduction:** Every field/step = potential dropout

### For Ads
- **3-Second Rule:** Hook must work instantly
- **Faces:** Humans are wired to notice faces
- **Movement:** Attracts attention (video > static)
- **Contrast:** Stands out from environment
- **Emotional Arc:** Setup → tension → release

### For Content
- **Story Structure:** Brain processes narratives differently (more engaging)
- **Concrete Examples:** Activate sensory processing
- **Analogies:** Link new info to existing knowledge
- **Chunking:** Break complex info into digestible pieces
- **Repetition:** Builds memory but risks habituation

### For Email
- **Subject Lines:** Curiosity + relevance + brevity
- **Preview Text:** Extends the hook
- **Personalization:** Self-referential processing boost
- **Timing:** Circadian rhythms affect attention/decision-making

## When Neuroscience Says "Don't"

Not every tactic works for every situation:

| Tactic | When It Backfires |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Scarcity** | When it feels manufactured or manipulative |
| **Social Proof** | When numbers are low or unconvincing |
| **Fear Appeals** | When too intense (causes avoidance) |
| **Complexity** | When System 2 is already fatigued |
| **Novelty** | When trust is more important than attention |
| **Urgency** | When the decision needs consideration |

**Memory Encoding:** [What will make this memorable? What's distinctive?]

**Emotional Trigger:** [Which emotion? Why is it appropriate?]

**Cognitive Load:** [Is this easy to process? What could be simplified?]

**Bias Leverage:** [Which cognitive biases support this? Are they ethical?]

**Potential Issues:** [What might not work from a brain science perspective?]
```

## Quick Reference Card

**Before Publishing Anything, Ask:**

1. **Will they notice it?** (Attention)
2. **Will they get it instantly?** (Processing)
3. **Will they feel something?** (Emotion)
4. **Will they remember it?** (Memory)
5. **Will they act on it?** (Decision)
6. **Will they trust it?** (Authenticity)

If the answer to any of these is "no" or "maybe," revise before publishing.
