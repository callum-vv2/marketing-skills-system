### Content Mission Statement
Every brand needs a clear content mission that defines:
- The core audience
- What content you deliver
- The outcome for the audience

**Template:**
"[Brand] is where [audience] gets [content type] that helps them [outcome]."

**Example:**
"Moz is where marketers get SEO education that helps them rank higher and drive more traffic."

### Content Tilt
The unique angle that makes your content stand out:
- Find the intersection of what you know, what audience needs, and what competitors miss
- Be the leading expert in a narrow topic
- "Own" a content niche before expanding

### Six Principles of Epic Content
1. Fill a need
2. Be consistent
3. Be human
4. Have a point of view
5. Avoid "sales speak"
6. Be best of breed

        └─────────────────┘             └─────────────────┘
```

### Content Audit Framework

For each piece of content, ask:
1. Is it accurate and up-to-date?
2. Does it serve a clear user need?
3. Does it align with business objectives?
4. Is it findable when needed?
5. Does it reflect our brand voice?

**ROT Analysis:**
- **R**edundant - Duplicates other content
- **O**utdated - No longer accurate
- **T**rivial - No real value

### Core Strategy Statement
"Our content will help [audience] to [goal] by [approach]."
