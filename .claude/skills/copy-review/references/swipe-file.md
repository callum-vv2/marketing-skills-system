**What I liked:**
What I really like on the "Get to Know Ramp" section is they keep the copy very simple. Like in the feature cards, you've got:
- Ramp Intelligence (two words)
- Put Ramp AI to work for you (one sentence)
- Then an image
They let the product do the speaking for them, and it's all very simple, easy, and clear what their features and their value proposition are.

**Why it works:**
The simplicity and clarity of the wording effectively communicate the key features and value proposition, making it easy for users to grasp the benefits of the product at a glance.

**The content:**
```
Ramp Intelligence (two words)
Put Ramp AI to work for you (one sentence)
```
